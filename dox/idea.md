# Project Idea  

## Overview  
This project is a **mini on-demand video streaming platform** where only the admin can upload and manage content. Users can browse, search, and stream videos with a smooth playback experience.  

## Features  
- **Video Library**: A collection of videos categorized for easy navigation.  
- **High-Quality Streaming**: Adaptive bitrate streaming for seamless playback.  
- **Admin Control**: Only the admin can upload, edit, and delete videos.  
- **Search & Filtering**: Users can quickly find videos based on categories, titles, or tags.  

## Goal  
The goal is to build a **lightweight, scalable video streaming platform** similar to Netflix or Amazon Prime Video but without user-generated content. The focus is on **efficient content delivery, smooth UI, and admin-controlled uploads**.
